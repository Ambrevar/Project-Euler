This problem is not very intersting on an algorithmic point of view. Pen and
paper are more than enough.

The notation _a->b_ means _the number of letters used to write digits from 'a' to 'b'_.
The notation _%a_ means _the number of letters used to write 'a'_.

20..30->90 = 46

1->99 = (1->9)*8 + (20..30->90)*10 + (10->19)
      = 36*9 + 46*10 + 70
      = 854

%100 = 7

%and = 3

%1000 = 11

1->1000 = (1->99)*10 + (%and)*99*9 + (1->9)*100 + (%100)*900 + (%1000)
        = 854*10     + 3*99*9      + 36*100     + 7*900      + 11
        = 21124
